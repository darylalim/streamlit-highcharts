# Highcharts for Python — Data Visualizations

Generate data visualizations with the
[Highcharts for Python](https://github.com/highcharts-for-python) toolkit. This
repo is an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app that builds them
from pandas DataFrames — **every chart is produced by `highcharts-core`**, with
no native Streamlit charts.

## Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

```bash
uv sync
```

## Run

```bash
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:8501>. Pick a sample dataset (or upload a CSV),
choose a chart type and columns, and toggle between an interactive (CDN) chart
and a static PNG render.

## What it does

- Turns a `pandas.DataFrame` into a Highcharts options `dict`, then a `Chart`
  via `Chart.from_options(...)`.
- Two render modes via the **"Static image (PNG)"** toggle:
  - **Interactive** (default): serialize the chart with its own
    `get_script_tags()` (Highcharts CDN `<script>` tags) + `to_js_literal()`,
    wrap it in a small HTML document, and embed it with `st.iframe`. Highcharts
    JS runs in the browser.
  - **Static**: render server-side with `chart.download_chart(format="png")`
    and show the PNG with `st.image` (plus a download button). No Highcharts JS
    runs in the browser; the process talks to the Highcharts export server.
- Supported chart types: `line`, `spline`, `area`, `column`, `bar`, `pie`,
  `scatter`.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `streamlit_app.py` | The Streamlit UI: data source, chart controls, caching, render-mode toggle, and the chart embed. |
| `highcharts_builder.py` | Pure (Streamlit-free) functions that turn a DataFrame into a Highcharts options dict, a `Chart`, and embeddable HTML / PNG bytes. Independently importable and unit-testable. |
| `tests/test_smoke.py` | Builder unit tests (parametrized over chart types, with the missing-data and scatter edge cases and the validation guards) plus headless `AppTest` interaction tests. |

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest
```

`tests/test_smoke.py` covers the builder across every chart type (parametrized),
the missing-data and scatter edge cases, and the validation guards, then drives
the full app headless with Streamlit's `AppTest` — switching controls and
asserting on the generated config and the guard warnings.

## Lint & format

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and
formatting (config in `pyproject.toml`).

```bash
# Auto-fix lint issues and format (run before committing):
uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .

# Verify only, exactly as CI does (non-mutating):
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```

Optional: install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks so this runs
automatically on every commit:

```bash
uv tool install pre-commit && pre-commit install
```

VS Code users get format-on-save and fix-on-save via the committed
`.vscode/settings.json` (install the recommended Ruff extension).

## Type check

This project uses [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/), Astral's fast Python type
checker. Because ty resolves third-party imports from the project venv, run it
through `uv run`:

```bash
uv run ty check
```

It runs in CI and on every commit via pre-commit. A few `highcharts-core` stub
mismatches are suppressed inline with `# ty: ignore[rule]` (so the rules still
apply everywhere else); see `CLAUDE.md` for details.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs the tests, the Ruff lint/format checks, and the ty type
check on every push to `main` and every pull request
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Notes

- There is **no official Streamlit ↔ Highcharts component** (no `st.highcharts`
  widget) for the `highcharts-core` object model, so this app uses the
  dependency-free `Chart` → HTML → `st.iframe` bridge.
- In **interactive** mode, charts load Highcharts JS from the CDN
  (`https://code.highcharts.com/`), so the browser needs network access. The
  iframe has a fixed height (it does not auto-grow).
- In **static** mode, the running process must reach the Highcharts export
  server (`export.highcharts.com` by default). To remove that external
  dependency, self-host an export server and pass a `server_instance` to
  `download_chart`.

## Dependencies

Runtime:

- `highcharts-core` — Highcharts for Python charting library
- `pandas` — DataFrames feeding the charts
- `streamlit` — app runtime

Dev (in the `dev` dependency group, installed by `uv sync`):

- `pytest` — tests
- `ruff` — linter and formatter
- `ty` — type checker
- `watchdog` — faster, more reliable Streamlit hot-reload
